# PandasReadingDataFromMultipleSources

This is a Pandas Notebook that creates and displays data in different types of formats~ .csv, .tsv, .xlxs, .json, and a 

postgresql database table.  The survey_results_public.csv, modified.json, modified2.json, and the postgresql database table 


were all to big to upload to GitHub. You can run the Notebook for yourselves and get them on your machine. The survey_results_public.csv was downloaded from Stack Overflow; contact me through GitHub if you want a copy from me.  I used the password "14" for the postgre datebase while I was using that code.  I hope you enjoy this code; if you have any questions feel free to reach out.
